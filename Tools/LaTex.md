# Introduction

LaTex is a good alternatives to word.
It can separate the content and style of the article.

You need 3 things to write your own LaTex: Distribution, Processor and Editor

# Distribution

There are two common distribution in LaTex: Miktex and texlive.
[This article](https://www.texdev.net/2016/12/18/tex-on-windows-tex-live-versus-miktex-revisited/) discusses the difference between them.

## Miktex

* Download from https://miktex.org/download
* It can install necessary packages on the fly. Don't need to install all packages (about 5G)  in one time.

# Processor

There are several processor: Like LaTex, LuaTex, XeTeX...

They have some difference.
You can refer to [Differences between LuaTeX, ConTeXt and XeTeX](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/36/differences-between-luatex-context-and-xetex).
